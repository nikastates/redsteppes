					<p>Ashton, <br>for once go taste your own strong salt <br>go touch the crowded tongues of mustard <br>go kiss the cormorant bones <br>but don't hold me; my hands can't offer help <br>Go find a frame where I am not the only thing <br>in which you see yourself<br><br>Ashton, <br>you wrap yourself up in that nice brown bag <br>You squint into that amber spyglass, and you spot steadier land <br>where I see stars above the softest marsh's mud <br>If you can stand there you'll be proud, but if you can't <br>what passing hand will pull you up?<br><br>Underneath the sacks of seed and bags of sallow hay <br>up comes the cattail reed <br>Up comes the bottom of the bay <br>Go sew your broken teeth between the rows of overwatered wheat <br>A mouth may grow, the the field lays fallow. <br><br>Ashton, <br>what billows at your front porch now? <br>If that's your white shirt on the fishing wire <br>I will not cut it down <br>I won't hold you - I cannot keep you still <br>The wind's been chewing and the sun's slight ribs <br>and now it's getting at you, too.</p>

					<p>Come down from your ghostly perch <br>silver poplar, and congress of birch <br>Solemn bird, come down <br><br>Be a man who will not be cowed <br>a man with soft hands and a rubbery mouth <br>When one branch of the birch must be bowed <br>allow one banch to be bent, and one to be proud. <br><br>I take my sip from the fissured bell <br>I take what hits I can, and I raise my hell <br>Only time will tell which is free. <br><br>You take your sip from the lion's maw <br>You peck at his black lip, and you steal his barbed tongue <br>See what strange, strange harm a small bird has done. <br><br>Be a man who will not be feared <br>with a nest in your great russet beard <br>with a flush on your chest, and fierce cheer <br>and soft flesh where a feather once reared <br><br>Oh, my dear <br>be near <br><br>Bear away your gifts and your body of half-baked clay <br>Bear away your bottles of whistling beer <br>I am only a slip of myself just yet <br>you are only a feint frontier.

					<p>You weren't much <br>just dust swirling in your car <br>smoke on my mother's porch <br>and your flippant heart <br><br>I don't know you<br>I did not count your grey hairs <br>I cannot say you'll die before you hit sixty five <br>though you're likely to<br><br>Oh, I was caught in some long summer <br>gone black-eyed from borrowing your steam <br>So I lose myself sometimes <br>but I'm not unredeemed <br><br>I envy them: <br>your hands, and the space they span <br>the attention that they demand <br>and do not seem to mind <br><br>But you curse and fold just as autumn is crawling in <br>Still, what rampages eastward, wet and slickly red <br>won't make you bold <br><br>Oh, I was caught in some long summer <br>gone black-eyed from borrowing your steam <br>So I lose myself sometimes <br>but I'm not unredeemed <br><br>I pace low lately, in this box with its windows barred <br>a big cat in a circus cart, sleepless nextdoor for the gallery <br><br>But do your neighbours know <br>about the crowding of aborted scales <br>the vanished signal in the static space of interstates <br>and your loud, loud voice? <br><br> Oh, I was caught in some long summer <br>gone black-eyed from borrowing your steam <br>So I lose myself sometimes <br>but I'm not unredeemed

					<p>You lay your belly on the stone <br>You put your face down in the water <br>You wore my eyes, you wore your grandfather's sweatshirt <br>You wore that winter light as if it were a hood <br><br>You hung your head out like a dog <br>you drove the heat from me, you hollered <br>I turned the cliff <br>I turned my cold collar upward <br>You turned your lips to see your teeth bared to the wind <br><br>But send no call to cover me <br>no postman, and no pale grey gull <br>no road to the bridge above Bixby <br>In our aimlessness, we are faded <br>In our nights, man, we are all our own <br><br>And January is a joke <br>January is a fever <br>Your feet were cold, your faith could not be recovered <br>You bought me for a square of chocolate and a poem <br><br>I broke the turnstile and the phone <br>I broke the mouth of copper wire <br>I ate the basin with its clandestine orchard<br>I took your face in both my hands and watched it fall<br><br>But send no call to cover me<br>no postman, and no pale grey gull<br>no road to the bridge above Bixby<br>In our aimlessness, we are faded<br>In our nights, man, we are all our own<br><br>And we have both been castaways<br>but you're not sinking in these shallows<br>I am not letting go, and I do not agree to follow you down<br>You bear that heavy load; I am prepared to hear it now<br><br>But send no call to comfort me<br>Come quiet, or come not at all<br>by the road to the bridge above Bixby<br>On the face of it  nothing's fated<br>but in the nights, man, we are right where we belong

					<h2 id="idnsi">I DID NOT SPEAK IT</h2>
					<p>As all those houses falling waterward, I fell<br>with your back to the hills, with your clothing all filthy<br>standing terribly still<br><br>Like a child just barely old enough<br>to see that she won't long be young<br><br>I saw it<br>I did not believe it<br>so I did not speak it<br><br>And I woke wrapped in your riding jacket<br>with a mouthful of sand, with a throat full of furtive sadness<br>Like a widow startled by some strange resemblance<br><br>I saw you<br>but I did not know you<br>so I did not speak it<br><br>One lost post card from high country:<br>does it master me? Am I captive<br>trading an honest thing for more silence?<br><br>And I drove down to your dry white city with no sleep<br>With no place to call home<br>I was drawn past your door<br>I was drawn on and on<br>As if convinced by one small loss<br>that all that's gained comes at great cost<br><br>I called you<br>but I could not reach you<br>so I did not speak it

It'll take all of your trust<br>and wake your polaroids, and whittle down your poplar chest<br>and make you a real boy, with a bruise bloomed in your bonfire ribs.<br>I've got a bruise, too; I am proof that you get used to it."<br><br>I am just this:<br>sullen, and stateless<br>nothing but this artless thrumming<br>just this howling I do in the dark.
